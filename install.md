# Install Tessel

*New to the command line? [Take a step back and learn the basics.](cmd.html)*

Select the operating system you are working on.

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is a prerequisite for installing the Tessel command line. You can install it using nvm by running the following commands in your terminal:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.23.2/install.sh | bash`

`source ~/.bashrc`

`nvm install 0.12.7`

*Tessel's command line currently does not work on Node 4.x or higher; if you run `node --version` and see 4.something, please follow the instructions above. [[Track issue]](https://github.com/tessel/t2-start/issues/49)*

Once Node.js is installed, run this installation script from your terminal:

<big>`npm install -g t2-cli`</big>

*Note: If you get the common npm [EACCES error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16151018/npm-throws-error-without-sudo), correct it by running `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm` and then running `npm install -g t2-cli` again.*

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is a prerequisite for installing the Tessel command line. You can install it from the [official website](http://nodejs.org) or following [these instructions for your package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

If you are running Ubuntu _13.10 or later_, you can run this:

`apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy`

*Tessel's command line currently does not work on Node 4.x or higher; please install an earlier version. [[Track issue]](https://github.com/tessel/t2-start/issues/49)*

Once Node is installed, run this in your terminal:

`apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev`
`npm install -g t2-cli`

On Windows, Tessel drivers will install automatically when you plug in.

On Windows 7, you may receive the notification "Device driver software was not successfully installed". If you do, click on the notification, click the "Change settings..." button, and then select "Install driver software from Windows Update if it is not found on my computer." Save changes and re-try.

Next, install [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org). You need this to interact with Tessel from the command line.

*Tessel's command line currently does not work on Node 4.x or higher; if you run `node --version` and see 4.something, please [install an earlier version](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). [[Track issue]](https://github.com/tessel/t2-start/issues/49)*

After installing the Tessel drivers and Node.js, run this in cmd.exe:

<big>`npm install -g t2-cli`</big>

### A note on Tessel's bootup

Plug in your Tessel over USB (use Tessel's microUSB port, between the USB ports and the module ports).

**You must wait for the Tessel to finish booting up (~30s) before you can run commands. Look for the tiny green LED on the Ethernet port to turn on to signal a full bootup.**

*This bootup issue is because Tessel 2 is still in development; track the issue [here](https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/issues/346).*

### Find your Tessel

Run:

`t2 list`

You should be able to see your Tessel connected:

{% highlight sh %}
INFO Searching for nearby Tessels...
	Tessel-AF768F095	USB
{% endhighlight %}

Yay, you found it! At this point, your Tessel is operational and in communication with your computer.

**Bonus:** give your Tessel a name, like "Frank" or "Bulbasaur":

`t2 rename <name>`

If you run `t2 list` again, you'll see your Tessel has changed its name:

{% highlight sh %}
INFO Searching for nearby Tessels...
	Bulbasaur	USB
{% endhighlight %}
